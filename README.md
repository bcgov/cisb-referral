## About

This is a default [README.md](README.md) file generated by the Wizard. Customize it for your project.

## Additional configuration steps

Several manual configuration steps are recommended:

* Pull Request behaviour
    * Click `Settings > General` scroll down to `Pull Requests` and check `Always suggest updating pull request branches`
* Branch Protection Rules
    * Click `Settings > Branches` then click `Edit` for the `main` branch. Scroll down and check `Require linear history`
    * Branch Protection on `main` has been setup by default, however the [QuickStart for OpenShift ReadMe](https://github.com/bcgov/quickstart-openshift?tab=readme-ov-file#branch-protection-rules) recommends creating a new `branch ruleset`.
* [Create SonarCloud tokens](https://github.com/bcgov/quickstart-openshift/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#secrets-values)
* [Add the Renovate App](https://github.com/bcgov/quickstart-openshift/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#renovate)
* [Read about the packaged workflows](https://github.com/bcgov/quickstart-openshift?tab=readme-ov-file#workflows)
